# ${1:Find Divvy Bikes}

## What is Divvy
Divvy (Bikes) is Chicago's newest transit system with hundreds of stations across the city. 24/7

## History
I was bored one night so after see that Divvy Bikes has the data open (I'm not sure if it's open-source) to anyone who could inspect the website and see the request to the JSON to use I thought it could be nice to do a little experiment using Node.js to do the Ajax call and Handlebars.js as my engine view.
